## Module Descriptions

### Document Parser (`backend/parsers/`)

Accepts PDF and DOCX files uploaded via the API. Extracts raw text using PyMuPDF or pdfplumber for PDFs and python-docx for DOCX. Returns a plain text string for downstream processing.

Supported formats: PDF, DOCX

### Text Cleaner (`backend/utils/`)

Receives raw extracted text and removes unwanted characters, extra whitespace, and formatting artifacts. Normalizes text to a consistent format before NLP processing.

### Resume Parser (`backend/parsers/`)

Runs the cleaned text through a spaCy NLP pipeline to identify and extract structured sections.

Pipeline steps:
* Tokenization
* Lemmatization
* Named Entity Recognition (NER)
* Section boundary detection using header keywords
* Keyword extraction per section

Outputs a structured dictionary with keys: `skills`, `education`, `experience`, `projects`, `certifications`.

### Embedding Engine (`backend/embeddings/`)

Uses the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` Sentence Transformer model to convert resume text and job description text into dense vector embeddings. Both are generated independently and passed to the Similarity Engine.

### Similarity Engine (`backend/services/`)

Computes cosine similarity between the resume embedding and the job description embedding using scikit-learn. Returns a float score between 0 and 1.

### ATS Scoring Engine (`backend/ats/`)

Calculates a weighted ATS score (0–100) across the following metrics:

| Metric               | Weight |
|----------------------|--------|
| Keyword Match        | 30%    |
| Skill Match          | 25%    |
| Experience Match     | 20%    |
| Education Match      | 10%    |
| Resume Completeness  | 10%    |
| Contact Information  | 5%     |

### Recommendation Engine (`backend/services/`)

Compares extracted resume skills and keywords against the job description. Produces:
* List of missing skills
* List of missing keywords
* Actionable improvement suggestions

### REST API (`backend/api/`)

Built with FastAPI. Exposes endpoints for upload, parse, match, and recommend. All responses are JSON. See `docs/api.md` for full endpoint reference.
